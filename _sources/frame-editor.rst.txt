Frame editor
============

This guide explains how to work with the **frame editor** for editing source code, :doc:`LaTeX documents <latex>`, :doc:`Command-line terminal <terminal>` etc. The screenshot below shows a Python file and a Terminal. In order to get that view, the frame editor is split vertically first, and then the right frame is splitted horizontally. After that, the bottom right frame is changed to a :doc:`Terminal <terminal>`.

Therefore, you can not only view the same Python source code file in two places, but you can also work with e.g. IPython_ on the command-line in the same directory.
